  <p>The full moon day in the month of Ashadha (July-August) is known as Guru Purnima. This sacred day marks the very first transmission of the yogic sciences from Shiva – the Adiyogi or First Yogi – to the Saptarishis, the seven celebrated sages. This momentous occasion took place on the banks of the lake Kantisarovar, which stands a few kilometers above the Kedarnath Temple in the Himalayas. Thus, the Adiyogi became the Adi Guru or the First Guru on this day. The Saptarishis carried this knowing offered by Adiyogi throughout the world. Even today, every spiritual process on the planet draws from the spine of knowing created by Adiyogi.</p>
    <br />
  <p style="padding-right:20px; padding-left:40px;">“Guru Poornima marks one of the greatest moments in the life of humanity. This is a day that is reminiscent of Adiyogi opening up and offering the possibility that a human being can evolve beyond all limitations set by his physical nature, if willing to strive. This first full moon day after the solstice is a time when this planet and all life upon it are most receptive to the cosmic energy and possibilities. The next six months till the winter solstice is the best time to strive for evolving and experiencing the divine possibility that is innate in a human being.”
  <br />
  <br />  
  <em>- Sadhguru</em></p>

  <h2>Celebrating Guru Purnima</h2>
  <br />  
  <p>The word "Guru" in Sanskrit is translated as "dispeller of darkness." Hence the Guru dispels the darkness of ignorance and leads the aspirants on the path to enlightenment. The day of Guru Purnima is traditionally the time when seekers offer the Guru their gratitude and receive his blessings. Guru Purnima is also considered an especially beneficial day to practice yogic sadhana and meditation.
   <br />
   <br />
   At the Isha Yoga Center this year, on July 12th, Sadhguru will be unveiling the Adiyogi statue, and a sathsang with Sadhguru will take place from 6PM July 12th to 12:30AM July 13th. Those who wish to attend are requested to pre-register <a href="http://isha.co/1mblTrI"  title="Pre-registration form for Guru Poornima 2014" target="_blank">online</a> or at their local centers before 8th July. There is no donation required for the event itself but you are always welcome to support if you wish to. All registrations will close on the 8th of July. There will be no spot registration.
   <br />
   <br /> 
  Isha also offers the Guru Paduka Stotram, a powerful chant that glorifies the “sandals of the Guru,” which are symbolically represented as “the boat to help cross the endless ocean of life.” This chant enables one to become receptive to the Guru’s Grace. The chant is a part of the Vairagya album and can be downloaded as a free android app or mp3s. The mp3s also include the free ebook, "Shiva - Ultimate Outlaw", by Sadhguru.

  <h2>Dhyanalinga – A Live Guru</h2>
  <br />  
  <p>On this significant day, visitors were accorded the rare privilege and honour of personally making an offering of Ksheera (milk) or Jala (water) to the <a href="http://www.dhyanalinga.org"  title="Dhyanalinga" target="_blank">Dhyanalinga</a>. Ksheera can be offered from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and Jala from 12:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.</p>

  </div>  
   <br /> 
  <p>The Dhyanalinga is an energy center of tremendous proportions – a doorway to enlightenment and liberation. An extraordinary meditative space, the Dhyanalinga does not ascribe to any particular faith or belief system, nor does it require any ritual, prayer, or worship. Just sitting silently in its sphere is enough to make even those unaware of meditation, experience deep states of meditativeness. As Sadhguru says, “Anyone who comes into the sphere of the Dhyanalinga cannot escape the sowing of the spiritual seed of liberation.”   
  <br />
  <br />
  In the metaphysical sense, Dhyanalinga is a Guru, an energy center of tremendous proportions. All the aspects of life are enshrined in the form of seven chakras energized to the very peak and locked. Dhyanalinga offers a sadhaka the opportunity to perform sadhana in utmost intimacy with a Guru, a privilege usually available only to very few individuals.</p>

  <p>Guru Purnima also marks the beginning of the <a href="http://www.ishayoga.org/hata/teachertraining/"  title="Isha Hata Yoga Teacher Training Program" target="_blank">Isha Hata Yoga Teacher Training Program</a>, which offers classical Hata Yoga in its full depth and dimension. The 21-week course establishes classical Yoga in its true form, to revive and impart various dimensions of this ancient science which are largely absent in the world today. The training is conducted at the Adiyogi Alayam at the Isha Yoga Center. Specially consecrated by Sadhguru, the energy in the Alayam is deeply transformative and particularly conducive for learning Hata Yoga.</p>
